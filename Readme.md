1. I have not written code for a year. That is sad - but it also means that i have forgotten how to setup a lot of this stuff. So its probably janky - should add to realism ...

2. you may have to force fix vulns, its a kata -> i haven't really cared. I suggest you dont deploy to prod.

3. `npm install`
4. `npm test`
